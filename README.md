## Project Pitch: Classwork Creation Tool

**The Problem in Computer Science Classrooms**

In computer science education, learning works best when it's active, adaptive, and collaborative. Students learn more by doing - writing code, discussing ideas, and solving problems - than by simply listening to lectures. Working with classmates helps you see different ways to think about a problem, and having an instructor nearby provides expert guidance and immediate feedback. The most effective classroom activities combine these elements into a single, interactive experience.

However, creating that kind of experience in a CS course is challenging. Students enter with different levels of experience and learn at different speeds. Instructors have limited time and attention - they're expected to lecture, guide, and manage all at once. A single lesson might need to mix several types of tasks: coding problems, short written answers, and auto-graded quizzes. Each of these requires different grading tools and feedback methods, from unit tests to rubrics to multiple-choice grading systems.

Existing tools only partially meet these needs.

- Document editors (like Google Docs) are great for collaboration, but they can't grade code automatically.
- Coding environments (like VS Code or Jupyter Notebooks) allow hands-on programming but lack structure for guided exercises.
- Quiz platforms (like Canvas or Google Forms) handle auto-grading well but aren't built for open-ended, interactive learning.
- As a result, instructors often switch between several platforms - losing time and breaking the flow of learning. Students may complete activities without really understanding the underlying concepts.

**The Solution: CoFlowCode**

CoFlowCode will bridges these gaps by offering a unified platform for creating and running interactive in-class assignments. Within a single document, instructors can mix: Text explanations, open-ended free-response questions, runnable code cells, and automatically graded exercises. Each activity can have its own grading logic through tests, rubrics, or AI-based feedback. Instructors can also set mastery checkpoints that ensure students fully understand a topic before moving forward. CoFlowCode also supports collaboration, so students can work in pairs or small groups, and integrates smoothly with tools like Canvas to make setup and grading easier.

With CoFlowCode, assignments become living, interactive documents. Students learn by coding, reflecting, and collaborating. Instructors gain insight into how students are thinking and can provide immediate, personalized feedback. The result is a classroom experience that feels more like an interactive lab than a passive lecture.

And that's what you're going to be making this semester! Or the frontend of it, anyway.
